# Landing Page Test

This test consists of building a HTML page based on the design below. The page must be responsive and adapt when scaling down to mobile. For this exercise, we will leave out a tablet version.

You are free to come up with how it will downsize and look on mobile.

If you are unable to open the PSD file, please let us know and we will provide the assets separately.

Upon completion of the test, please include a short paragraph on the following key points.

Thoughts on how you decided on your design for the mobile version.  How you plan the transition between platforms.

The original desktop design is very simple and is valid for mobile version with some adjustments. For the mobile version I increased font sizes for better reading and reduced margins for better use of space.

I chose hide the badges because I think are not necessary and do not contribute much. However I have included it on the tablet version where you can see better.



What coding languages you have used to complete the test and why you have used them (If you have used any).

SASS for the preprocess in CSS

I think the preprocessors are the best way to write CSS. More easy, more safe and you can reuse code. For me is mandatory.

Compass mixins

Is a big collection of useful and common mixins.

My own library to manage CSS Breakpoints (sass.at-break).

Middleman (Ruby)

A static html generator (Is very similar to Rails).

To compile SASS in real-time.

Using partials and layouts.

To a improved integration with any server-side language.

Explain why you have chosen to use images or text for the main area of the page.

Overall I think it's better to use texts. They are lighter and can translate from database. But it is not mandatory. Sometimes it is better to use an image that automatically adapts to different widths. Or maybe because the design is too complex.

I've chosen to use texts but It depends the project requirements, complex designs, needed several languages or even short time to finish the project.

General structure/positioning of the elements.

Most elements follow its natural flow. It is easier for adaptive sites.

I have used mobile-first design. First I have created the mobile version and later I have added breakpoints to tablet (or more) and desktop (or more).

Briefly describe what you would have done for a tablet version.

I have done a tablet light version. It's easy when you use responsive web design. I have moved the badges into the main box.

Please state approximate time taken to complete the test.

Approximately 5 hours.

Any comments you wish to include.

The design of the desktop version is very similar to mobile style. I think we could do something different, more width, maybe two columns.
